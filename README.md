# BLEShark-Nano-VPN-US-Firmware-Guide
I wrote down a guide for EU customers of the BLEShark Nano to download the US firmware instead of the EU firmware. 
The reason why i have to split it between my windows pc and my kali linux notebook is that my windows pc don't have a inbuild wifi module on the mainboard.
My external wifi adapter is not working correctly as AP at windows. So i have to do this with this workaroud. 
The guide is structurally not perfect yet, so there will be an update as soon as I have more time for it.
